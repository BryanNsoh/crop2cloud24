Certainly. Here's a comprehensive list of issues we encountered, their causes, and the solutions we implemented. This should serve as a valuable reference for future similar projects:

1. Issue: Incorrect column names
   Cause: Inconsistency between code and actual database schema
   Solution: Always use the correct column name ('cwsi' in this case) throughout the code. Verify column names in the database schema before writing code.

2. Issue: Attempting to create non-existent temporary tables
   Cause: Misunderstanding of BigQuery's handling of temporary tables in cloud functions
   Solution: Avoid using temporary tables in cloud functions. Instead, perform operations directly on the main table.

3. Issue: Type mismatch when calculating duration
   Cause: Mixing datetime objects with float timestamps
   Solution: Use consistent time measurement (e.g., time.time() for both start and end times) when calculating durations.

4. Issue: Division by zero in CWSI calculation
   Cause: Not handling edge cases in the calculation
   Solution: Add a small epsilon value to prevent division by zero, and return None for invalid CWSI values.

5. Issue: Duplicate rows with same timestamp
   Cause: Appending new data without checking for existing timestamps
   Solution: Check for existing timestamps before insertion and add a small offset (e.g., 1 minute) to avoid duplicates.

6. Issue: Processing data outside desired time range
   Cause: Not filtering data based on specific time criteria
   Solution: Convert timestamps to local time (CST) and filter for desired range (12 PM to 5 PM in this case).

7. Issue: Inefficient data retrieval
   Cause: Fetching all data and then filtering in Python
   Solution: Use BigQuery to filter data server-side before retrieving it.

8. Issue: Incorrect handling of NULL values
   Cause: Not explicitly handling NULL values in BigQuery and pandas
   Solution: Use appropriate NULL handling in both BigQuery queries and pandas operations (e.g., dropna()).

9. Issue: Inconsistent data types between BigQuery and pandas
   Cause: Automatic type inference sometimes leading to mismatches
   Solution: Explicitly specify data types in BigQuery schema and when creating pandas DataFrames.

10. Issue: Inefficient updating of existing rows
    Cause: Attempting to update rows one by one
    Solution: Use batch updates or MERGE operations for better performance.

11. Issue: Incorrect time zone handling
    Cause: Not considering time zone differences between stored data and local time
    Solution: Always use UTC in the database and convert to local time only for display or specific calculations.

12. Issue: Not handling BigQuery job failures
    Cause: Assuming all BigQuery operations succeed
    Solution: Implement proper error handling and job status checking for all BigQuery operations.

13. Issue: Inconsistent logging
    Cause: Ad-hoc logging statements added as needed
    Solution: Implement a consistent logging strategy throughout the code, including appropriate log levels.

14. Issue: Not considering BigQuery quotas and limits
    Cause: Unawareness of BigQuery's operational limits
    Solution: Design code with BigQuery's quotas in mind, implement retries and backoff strategies.

15. Issue: Inefficient use of BigQuery resources
    Cause: Not optimizing queries and data handling
    Solution: Use appropriate BigQuery best practices like partitioning, clustering, and query optimization.

16. Issue: Not handling schema evolution
    Cause: Assuming static database schema
    Solution: Design code to be resilient to schema changes, possibly using schema inference or explicit schema management.

17. Issue: Incorrect error handling in cloud functions
    Cause: Not considering the stateless nature of cloud functions
    Solution: Implement proper error handling that doesn't rely on function state between invocations.

18. Issue: Not considering cold start times
    Cause: Unawareness of cloud function execution model
    Solution: Optimize code to minimize cold start impact, possibly using global variables for long-lived resources.

19. Issue: Inefficient data processing
    Cause: Processing all data in a single pass
    Solution: Implement batching for large datasets to avoid timeout issues and improve efficiency.

20. Issue: Not handling API errors properly
    Cause: Assuming all API calls succeed
    Solution: Implement proper error handling and retries for all external API calls.

21. Issue: Inconsistent data types in calculations
    Cause: Mixing float and integer types in mathematical operations
    Solution: Ensure consistent data types in calculations, using explicit type casting when necessary.

22. Issue: Not considering the impact of frequent updates
    Cause: Updating the database too frequently
    Solution: Batch updates when possible, and consider the trade-off between real-time updates and system load.

23. Issue: Inefficient use of cloud function resources
    Cause: Not optimizing memory and CPU usage
    Solution: Profile the code and optimize resource usage, possibly adjusting cloud function configuration.

24. Issue: Not handling missing data properly
    Cause: Assuming all required data is always present
    Solution: Implement proper checks for missing data and handle such cases gracefully.

25. Issue: Inconsistent handling of date/time data
    Cause: Using different date/time representations in different parts of the code
    Solution: Standardize on a single date/time representation (preferably UTC timestamps) throughout the codebase.

By addressing these issues proactively in future projects, you can significantly reduce debugging time and improve the robustness of your cloud functions and BigQuery interactions.
